How to Make a Code Contribution
-------------------------------

PyStan adopts virtually all the conventions and procedures discussed in Astropy's `How to make a
code contribution`_. Deviations, if any emerge, will be added to this section.

In general, contributions which follow the project's coding style, have tests, and solve a specific
problem will be merged. Here the project follows the spirit of the `Collective Code Construction
Contract (C4)`_.

Coding Style
------------

PyStan code is `PEP 8`_ compliant. The project uses the code formatter black_ with a maximum
line-length of 119 characters.
